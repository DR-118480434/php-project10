		<h2 style="text-align:center;">About</h2>
		<p>An immersive experience is an illusory environment that completely surrounds you such that you feel that you are inside it and part of it.
		   The term is associated with technology environments that command the senses such as virtual reality and mixed reality. 
		   Immersion enhances everyday experiences, making them more realistic, engaging, and satisfying on all our devices—whether we are playing a video game on our smartphone, video conferencing on our tablet, or watching sports on our Virtual Reality (VR) headset.</p>
		
		<h2 style="text-align:center;">Three Key Ingredients</h2>
		<h3>Visual Quality</h3>
		<p>Visual quality isn’t only about pixel quantity, like the resolution and frame rate.
		   It’s also about pixel quality. Color accuracy, contrast, and the just right amount of brightness are equally critical to making experiences more immersive.</p>
		<h3>Sound Quality</h3>
		<p>The two key dimensions of sound quality are high-resolution audio and sound integrity. We are truly immersed in the experience only when the sound is realistic and totally in sync with the visuals.
		   In contrast, when the sound quality is compromised, it is immediately noticeable</p>
		<h3>Intuitive Interactions</h3>
		<p>Intuitive interactions keep us immersed in an experience by stimulating our senses with realistic feedback.
		   Natural user interfaces and contextual interactions are the two key dimensions for intuitive interactions.</p>
