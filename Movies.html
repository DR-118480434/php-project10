            <p>Movies are one of my favourite pastimes as they allow people to just relax and zone out. Not to mention movies can be very entertaining. With the use of Netflix and other various streaming services accessing movies and tv shows has never been easier and I think these are great tools to engross yourself in the worlds of these movies and tv shows.</p>
            <p> Some of my favourite movies to watch are Action, Comedy or Thriller movies. There are some great movies in these two genres and they always leave your mind thinking afterwards. Some of my favourite movies of all time include Shutter Island, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Step Brothers.</p>
            <p>I am also a big fan of sit-coms. Some of my favourite include Friends, The U.S. Office and Parks and Recreation.</p>
