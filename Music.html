            <p>My preferred genre of music is hip-hop. Since I was young i always had an interest in the genre and that interest has grown into a passion. I spend most of my days listening to music on Spotify and feel annoyed when I don't spend part of my day relaxing and listening to music. Rap isn't all that I listen to either as I often find myself dipping into other various genres from time to time.</p>
            <p>Some of my favourite artists to listen to include Eminem, Kanye West, 2Pac, XXXTentacion and Kendrick Lamar. I find these artist's music very inspiring and their discography's are some of the greatest out there in my opinion.</p>
            <p> My favourite albums from these artists include Graduation, Me Against the World and Damn.</p>
