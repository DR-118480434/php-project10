            <img src ='ManUtd.jpg' style='width:500px;height:300px' Alt='Crest'>
            <p style="color:white;">My favourite team are Manchester United. I have followed them since I was young due to my father and two grandfather's allegiance to the club. The team I grew up watching made me fall in love with the sport and watching them win trophy after trophy was a great part of my childhood. Although recent years have been a difficult time for the team on the pitch this has not stopped me in the slightest of supporting the team week in and week out.</p>
            <p style="color:white;">There have been many great players to have worn the Manchester United over the years but I would have to say my favourite of all time would be Roy Keane. Keane played for United over 300 times winning 7 Premiership titles, 4 F.A. Cups and a Champions League. Roy also captained the club.</p>
            <p style="color:white;"> Roy's leadership and toughness on the pitch are only some of the attributes he contains and those traits along with his tremendous footballing talent is why he is my favourite player.

    <p style="color:white;">As much as I like watching football I also enjoy playing it. As I no longer play with a team I now play on a weekly basis with my friends. Sport is a great way to stay active and healthy and playing football also allows me to spend tike and bond with my friends.</p>
