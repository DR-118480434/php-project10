            <p>Travelling is one of my dreams and is something I plan to do after college. I plan to spend at least a year abroad if I can as I feel everyone should go out and explore the world we live in. Some of the places I plan to visit are America,across Europe, Asia and Africa.</p>

            <p>I also believe travelling and experiencing the world and other cultures is very important and allow people to fully experience life. To travel is to live, they say. Travelling not only teaches us the value of life, but also makes us learners and observers. It compels us to think about everything that is right and wrong with this world. Not to mention, it shows us just how beautiful this world can be, when you think thereâ€™s just no hope.</p>
